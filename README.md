# Finding-Saints-in-Paintings
Fine-Tuning Vision Transformer (ViT) for iconography classification on christian paintings.


This experiment is based on the paper ("A Data Set and a Convolutional Model for Iconography Classification in Paintings")[https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458885] by Milani et al. from 2021.
In their paper, Milani et al. create an annotated data set of christian paintings. In the unprocessed data, there are 20 labels. Each label denotes a saint. Examples are the Virgin Mary (MARY) or Saint Sebastian (SEBASTIAN).
